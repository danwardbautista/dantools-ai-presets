# DanTools: AI Presets

This project allows users to create their own AI presets for various tasks. As long as the user has a valid OpenAI API key, they can create and save their own presets. All data is saved locally in the browser such as the chat history and Open AI API key. I made this project to help me understand the OpenAI integration and its potential use cases. I also practiced how to create a functioning AI chat system with a user-friendly interface.
